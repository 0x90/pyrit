=== Requirements ===

 * For CUDA support the Nvidia CUDA SDK must be installed and properly linked.
 * For Stream support you need Catalyst >= 8.12 and the AMD-Stream SDK >= 1.3
 * The OpenSSL library and headers.

=== Compilating ===

 * Compilation:
    Pyrit comes with one core and currently two extension modules. Compile and install the core module 'pyrit' by running
    
      ./setup.py build
      ./setup.py install    [as root]
      
    You can build and install the Stream/CUDA modules the same way if you want (and have the SDKs). Hardware support for those modules is auto-detected.

 * Installing:
    Python's distutils will install everything itself.

=== AMD Stream notes ===

 * installing AMD CAL + Brook on .deb systems is explained here: http://znuh.blogspot.com/2008/12/amd-stream-with-ubuntu-810-intrepid.html
