=== Requirements ===

 * For CUDA support the Nvidia CUDA SDK must be installed and properly linked.
 * For Stream support you need Catalyst >= 8.12 and Brook and CAL installed to /usr/local
 * The OpenSSL library and headers.

=== Compilating ===

 * Compilation:
    The CPyrit extension module must be compiled and installed. Modify setup.py according to your needs.
    Currently there two optional features:
      HAVE_CUDA will enable support for Nvidia CUDA capable devices
      HAVE_STREAM will enable support for AMD Stream capable devices
      HAVE_PADLOCK will enable support for VIA padlock hardware crypto
      
    Example:
      ./setup.py HAVE_CUDA build
      ./setup.py install

 * Installing:
    Python's distutils will install the CPyrit module to the site-packages directory itself.

=== AMD Stream notes ===

 * installing AMD CAL + Brook on .deb systems is explained here: http://znuh.blogspot.com/2008/12/amd-stream-with-ubuntu-810-intrepid.html
 * you can get some more speed with overclocking: LD_PRELOAD=libXinerama.so.1 aticonfig --odsc x,y (see aticonfig --help)
