Pyrit
+++++

A GPGPU-driven WPA/WPA2-PSK key cracker

Pyrit exploits the computational power of many-core- and GPGPU-platforms to
create massive databases, pre-computing part of the WPA/WPA2-PSK authentication
phase in a space-time tradeoff. 
It is a powerful attack against one of the world's most used security-protocols

Requirements
++++++++++++

Pyrit compiles and runs on Linux, FreeBSD and MacOS. Windows is not (and
probably never will be) supported; there are however some reports of successful
installations on Windows with the help of MinGW.

A couple of libraries and headers are required to build Pyrit:

  * Python >=2.5 and it's headers
    http://www.python.org
  * The OpenSSL library and headers
    http://www.openssl.org
  * Scapy 2.x (optional/runtime)
    http://www.secdev.org/projects/scapy/
  * SQLAlchemy (optional/runtime)
    http://www.sqlalchemy.org

Linux users running a binary distribution may need to install the development
packages for Python (e.g. python-devel), OpenSSL (e.g. openssl-devel or
libssl-dev). You also need a C-compiler like gcc. Users of MacOS probably
only need to have Xcode installed.



Installing
++++++++++

Unpack the source-code into a new directory like this:

    tar xvzf Pyrit-0.2.4.tar.gz


Switch to the main module's directory. We use Python's distutils to compile and
install the code:

    cd Pyrit-0.2.4
    python setup.py build


If everything went well and no errors are thrown at you, use distutils again to
install Pyrit:

    sudo python setup.py install


You can now execute 'pyrit' from your commandline; leave the source-code's
directory before doing so to prevent Python from getting confused with
module-lookups.
